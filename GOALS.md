## Assuming the list of names are fetched from an actual api, how would you implement authentication, rate limiting handling, error handling, api unavailability? - What kind of retry strategies youâ€™d imagine implementing?

Authentication:
* Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure authentication
* Implement refresh tokens to maintain user sessions without requiring frequent logins

Rate Limiting Handling:
* Implement client-side rate limiting to avoid overloading the server
* Use exponential backoff strategy to handle rate-limited requests

Error Handling:
* Display appropriate error messages to users and log errors for further analysis
* Implement retries for transient errors with exponential backoff

API Unavailability:
* Implement a fallback mechanism to display cached data when the API is unavailable
* Display user-friendly messages to inform users about API unavailability
* Use service workers for offline support

Retry Strategies:
* Exponential Backoff
* Circuit Breaker

## How can we protect the app from being abused?

* Rate Limiting
* CAPTCHA
* Input Validation
* Monitoring and Alerts

## How can we deploy the app into a cloud environment?

* Containerization
* Use cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting and scalability

## How can we be sure the app is running with the latest version of code?

* CI/CD Pipeline
* Feature Flags
* Monitoring and Alerts

## What techniques you can employ to ensure users are not disrupted when you make significant changes to code?

* Blue-Green Deployment (Use blue-green deployment to switch between two environments without downtime)
* Canary Releases (Gradually roll out changes to a small percentage of users before a full deployment)
* Zero-Downtime Deployments (Use rolling updates to deploy changes without stopping the application)

## What kind of accessibility best practices should we keep in mind?

## How would you structure the css so that we have the most reusability but also the least leakage between components?

* CSS Modules (Use CSS Modules to scope CSS to individual components and prevent leakage)
* BEM Methodology (Use the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes)
* SCSS/SASS (Use SCSS or SASS for advanced CSS features like variables, nesting, and mixins)

## Any other improvements that you feel like could be added.
